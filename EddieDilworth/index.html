    <h1> Key Demographics in the 2016 and 2012 Elections </h1>
    <p> The following map examines the importance of key demographics for Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama in their 2016 and 2012 elections respectfully. In every state that Obama won, and Clinton did not, you can examine the approximate number of votes (based on exit polls) that each candidate received from each racial and gender demographic. 
    </p>
    <p> You may examine whether Clinton would have won a chosen state if she had succeeded in a demographic to the extent that Obama did. 
    </p>
    <p> Here are some guiding questions for the data you might explore with this tool:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Explore: Look at demographics like whites or women, where Clinton was feasibly expected to do better than Obama. In nearly every state, did Clinton actually receive more votes? </li>
      <li> Find: On the other side of things, were there any demographics that Clinton consistently did better than Obama at? Which ones (if any)?</li>
      <li> Conclude: Were there any demographics where, in every state, Clinton would have won if she had succeeded to the extent that Obama did? </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Lastly, the user should know that the math going on is based on vote counts/percentages, not pure percentages. So, for example, even though Obama may have gotten a higher percentage of the Black vote in Florida, he still received less votes from African Americans. This can happen because a lower percentage of all the voters were black in the first place, or because there were far more voters in Florida this year than in 2012, making Clinton's smaller percentage still equal to more votes. </p>
